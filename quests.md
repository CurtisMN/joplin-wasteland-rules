# Quests
Quest items will be marked with pink tape and will have the quest
title on it. You may not move quest item unless you are on that
quest to get that quest item. If you are to bleed out and die and
you have a quest item, you must drop that quest item where you
died. Once you respawn back in you may go back to get the quest
item. NPCâ€™s that originally had said quest item may take the quest
item back. Note, a player may only have one side quest at a time.
If you wish to give up on a side quest, go back to the NPC that
hired you to do the quest and ask them to cancel the side quest.
