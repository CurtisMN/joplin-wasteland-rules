# QUESTS
Quest items will be marked with pink tape and will have the quest title on it. You may not move quest items unless you are on that quest to get that quest item. If you are to bleed out and die and you have a quest item, you must drop that quest item where you died. Once you respawn back in you may go back to get the quest item. NPCâ€™s that originally had said quest item may take the quest item back. Note, a player may only have one side quest at a time. If you wish to give up on a side quest, go back to the NPC that hired you to do the quest and ask them to cancel the side quest.

## Data
Joplin Wasteland is proud to present our next event, The Rise of Woodsend. March's story will follow Wate-Pa's last story, The Winter Storm. The raiders lead by Tim the Enhancer have taken over the town of Wate-pa. The mayor as been taken hostage and the sheriff fled the town after lying to the raiders, choosing to return a favor to Mr. Jones. Who was gunned down by the twisted judge and his town lackeys. Due to Tim the Enhancer not completing the ritual in Junk Town the storm was ended. Thus the sheriff and Mr. Jones would leave Wate-pa and make their way to the HQ of the Exit 4 Trade Guild. Soon after Exit 4 would send out a trade guild merchant named Snip Snap to deal with the Wate-pa problem. He would then set up shop in Woodsend, a small abandoned town outside of Wate-pa. The Bandit leader Cookie would be saved by a bandit that was not gunned down, vowing revenge on Mr. Jones of some kind. Soon after, a group of new bandits would take over the woods. All the meanwhile The Lord of Blood would make his way to Wata-pa. Hearing the deeds of his student to the great old ones, Tim the Enchanter.
