# Medical (Healing) and Looting

After the two minute bleed out you are dead. If you get looted
once, then you go back to your spawn, even if your two minutes are
not up. You cannot be looted on your way back to spawn after bleed
out even if you were not looted before. From there you wait 1
minute to spawn back in. Stimpaks

To use, rip the paper off the stimpak, then push the stimpak on to
the “bleeding” player. After that you or the player that as been
simpaked MUST yell out SIMPAK! The player is then back in the
game. You can not move or shoot when “bleeding out”, unless
someone moves you or you have the Endurance Perk. If the simpak
has exposed plastic or the wrapper is incomplete it can not be
used. Looting

You may loot people, that are "bleeding out." You may only take
two items of the following, off of the person: up to four Nuka
Caps, one field gun, one magazine, one piece of field armor, one
field shield or one field melee weapon. Carrying Bodies
You may use a two hand drag if your buddy is down. This means that
if you put both your hands on your buddy he may get up and WALK to
a new destination.
