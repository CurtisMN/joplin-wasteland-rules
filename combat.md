# COMBAT
## Airsoft
If hit in an unarmored spot, that causes Bleed Out .
## Melee
Melee goes through armor and causes Bleed Out. You may melee someone that is “bleeding out” to instant kill them. To melee, tap or lightly swipe your melee weapon on to your target and say “melee.” You may use a two hand touch to melee your victims, again say “melee” when doing so. 
## Energy(Foam Dart guns)
Energy weapons are designated by Nerf darts or foam balls. Laser gun rounds go through armor and cause power armor users to both fall under Bleed Out rules. When hit by a laser weapon, you will start to “bleed out”. Laser ammo can only be bought at a trader or found in loot. This will look like a ready to use mag with darts in it. You MAY NOT unload/load a nerf magazine no matter where you got it. Only traders and refs are authorized to do this. Players are not allowed to pick up used darts after they have been fired, unless authorized to do so by an NPC or ref. 
## Explosives
Frag Grenades (Enola Gaye, launched grenades, sound grenades and tornado/twister grenades) Anyone caught in the kill zone of a frag grenade is now under Bleed Out rules. There is a 20ft kill zone from the grenade (20ft radius) outside of buildings. Inside of a building the grenade kill zone is the whole room that the grenade goes off in.
## Smoke Grenades
Smoke Grenades - Certain smoke grenades fill a role at this event and are listed below, if you do not see a color listed it is just a regular smoke grenade and only serves as cover. There is a 10ft zone of affect from each grenade (10ft radius) and the smoke itself counts as an area of affect.
Gas Grenades(Yellow)
Gas grenades are designated by yellow smoke, players wearing a proper gas apparatus are immune to gas. Proper gas apparatus will be designated as a real gas mask, respirator, or full face eye protection with attached hoses and tanks. Any unprotected player caught in this area of effect is now under Bleed Out rules. 
Fire Grenades(Red)
Fire grenades are designated by red smoke. Any unprotected player caught in this area of effect is now under Bleed Out rules.
Radiation Grenades(Green)
Radiation grenades are designated by green smoke. When affected the victim may use a “rad-away stick” immediately and leave the area, otherwise they are now bleeding out. Any unprotected player caught in this area of effect is now under the Bleed Out rules.
## Traps
Some traps may be rigged with grenades. For these, follow any guidelines for the type of grenade released. Some traps may use airsoft guns, which you are to follow airsoft guidelines for bleed out. For safety and game play do not physically move or mess with the trap. Even if you see the trap before it goes off, do not move or mess with it.
