# COMBAT
## Airsoft
When shot, you then have a two minute bleed out.You must use the
full two minute bleed out before you go back to spawn, though
anyone can be revived by anyone else with a stimpak during this
bleed out time.
## Melee
If you melee someone, that is an instant kill and that player has
no bleed out and must go to their respawn point, but before they
leave you may loot the player.You may melee someone that is
“bleeding out.” To melee, tap or lightly swipe your melee weapon
on to your target and say “melee.” You may use a two hand touch to
melee your victims, again say “melee” when doing so.
## Energy(Foam Dart guns)
Energy weapons are designated by Nerf darts or foam balls.Laser
gun rounds go through armor and kill power armor users.When hit
by a laser weapon, you will start to “bleed out”.Laser ammo can
only be bought at a trader or found in loot.This will look like a
ready to use mag with darts in it.You MAY NOT unload / load a nerf
magazine no matter where you got it.Only traders and refs are
authorized to do this.Players are not allowed to pick up used
darts after they have been fired, unless authorized to do so by an
NPC or ref.
## Explosives
Frag Grenades(Enola Gaye, launched grenades, sound grenades and
tornado / twister grenades) There is a 20ft kill zone from the
grenade(20ft radius).Frag grenades stun power armor users for
30 seconds.
Mini Nukes, Mortar Artillery and Howitzer Artillery(rocket
launcher) - Mini nuke launchers / rocket launchers and mortar /
howitzer artillery rounds have the same type of killzone, which is
30ft from the fired round(30 ft radius) and cause players to
“bleed out.” If caught 5ft within fired round, players are
instantly dead and must go back to spawn and cannot be looted.
Approval is required for these rounds to follow standard.Mini
nukes are miniature nuclear bombs and must be of an approved
design.Artillery and artillery / howitzer rounds are simply mini
Nerf vortex howlers.These must be the ones with whistles to
count.
## Smoke Grenades
Certain smoke grenades fill a role at this event and are listed
below, if you do not see a color listed it is just a regular smoke
grenade and only serves as cover.There is a 10ft zone of affect
from each grenade(10ft radius) and the smoke itself counts as an
area of affect.Gas Grenades(Yellow)
Gas grenades are designated by yellow smoke, players wearing a
proper gas apparatus are immune to gas.Proper gas apparatus will
be designated as a real gas mask, respirator, or full face eye
protection with attached hoses and tanks.PA users are immune to
gas.Any unprotected player caught in this area of effect is now
bleeding out.Fire Grenades(Red)
Fire grenades are designated by red smoke.PA users are immune to
the effects of fire.Any unprotected player caught in this area of
effect is now bleeding out.Radiation Grenades(Green)
Radiation grenades are designated by green smoke.When affected
the victim may use a “rad - away stick” immediately and leave the
area, otherwise they are now bleeding out.PA users are immune to
radiation.Any unprotected player caught in this area of effect is
now bleeding out.EMP grenades(Blue)
Stun PA users for the duration that smoke is billowing from the
grenade and is surrounded by thick smoke. (Power armor users are
trained to know how long this is)
## Traps
Most traps work like a melee attack, if you get hit by a bb or you
are within 5ft of the trap you are dead, no bleed out, go back to
spawn.Some traps may be rigged with grenades.For these, follow
any guidelines for the type of grenade released.Some traps may
shoot guns, these will act just as a normal gun but without a
user.For safety and game play do not physically move or mess with
the trap.Even if you see the trap before it goes off do not move
or mess with it by hand, however, shooting or throwing items at
traps is legal.Traps go through armor, shields and power armor
users are stunned for 30 seconds after being hit by a trap with
the only exemption being grenade and gun traps.
