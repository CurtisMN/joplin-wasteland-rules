## Reloading    
The only two ways to find ammo in the “wasteland” or to buy ammo
from the NPCs. Prices may be different for each vendor and the
weight they sell for Nuka Caps.   
## In Game Currency
The Currency used in this game are marked “Nuka Caps.” You can
earn these caps by performing roles, quests, jobs, looting other
players/ NPC’s, selling items, and/or looting loot boxes. Red caps
are worth one, blue are worth five and yellow are worth ten.
Before the game begins you, the player, will be given ten caps to
start off with.
## Grenade Count
Players are allowed to begin the game with a limited number of
grenade-type weapons. The number of “grenade points” is six. Mini
nukes count as two points, elemental smoke/frag grenades of any
kind count as one. White smoke grenades do not count towards this
number, and are deemed personal items.
## Friendly fire counts
If you get hit by a friendly faction or team member you will still
fall under the effects of whatever was used to hit you.
## Field items
Field items will be marked by orange tape, you may use these items
in game and loot these items off of "bleeding out people.”
## Purple taped items
These are not to be touched or messed with, as they may be
personal player or NPC items. You can not use them, take them, or
move them.
## Bleed Out
If affected by any “Combat Methods” you then have a one minute bleed out. You pull out your dead rag, say place and not use any “Combat Methods.” You must use the full one minute bleed out before you go back to spawn though anyone can be revived by anyone else with a stimpak during this bleed out time. Melee and perks can affect the basic bleed out rulings.
