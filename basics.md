# BASICS:
Reloading - The only two ways to find ammo in the “wasteland” or to buy ammo from the NPCs. Prices may be different for each vendor and the weight they sell for Caps.

## In Game Currency
The Currency used in this game is marked “ Caps.” You can earn these caps by performing roles, quests, jobs, looting other players/ NPC’s, selling items, and/or looting loot boxes. Red caps are worth one, blue are worth five and yellow are worth ten. 

## Grenade Count
Players are allowed to begin the game with a limited number of grenade-type weapons. The number of “grenade points” is six. Elemental smoke/frag grenades of any kind count as one. White smoke grenades do not count towards this number, and are deemed personal items.   

## Friendly fire counts
If you get hit by a friendly faction or team member you will still fall under the effects of whatever was used to hit you. 
Field items - Field items will be marked by orange tape, you may use these items in game and loot these items off of "bleeding out people.” 

## Purple taped items
These are not to be touched or messed with, as they may be personal player or NPC items. You can not use them, take them, or move them.

## Bleed Out
If affected by any “Combat Methods” you then have a one minute bleed out. You pull out your dead rag, you stay in place and can not use any “Combat Methods.” You must use the full one minute bleed out before you go back to spawn though anyone can be revived by anyone else with a stimpak during this bleed out time. Melee and perks can affect the basic bleed out rulings. 

## Spawns
If you are to “bleed out” and die, then you return to your spawn. However, if you get looted once before your one minute is up, then you go back to your spawn, even if your minute is not up. You cannot be looted on your way back to spawn after bleeding out even if you were not looted before. Your spawn is based on what faction you are a part of. All non-wanderer spawn have a npc that you communicate to respawn back into the game. The wanderer spawn has no npcs at said spawn and as such you must wait one minute at the wanderer spawn before respawning back into the game. With the wanderer spawn there is no combat allowed within 50 ft of the spawn. 

## Rad Zones
Radiation zones will be marked with radiation signs. If a rad sign is posted at a doorway to a building or in a hallway to a building, then the area behind that zone is a radiation zone. If a rad sign is out in the open, say posted on a tree, then the radiation zone is the area that is ten feet from that sign. If you step into a radiation zone and you do not use a Rad Stick beforehand you are now bleeding out. 

## Town Combat
Towns are meant to be centers of role play and vending. As such no full on faction on faction combat is to happen in these areas. Combat will be allowed in these towns, however the size limit of the group of aggressors will be based on the number of total players and npcs for each game. The number limit will be stated at the game brief. If the aggressors are able to wipe out the town members, they will have two minutes to clear the town or be subject to give all loot over to the town leader and return to their spawn. Those aggressors are not able to engage in town combat in groups of two or more as the aggressor’s for at least one hour.
