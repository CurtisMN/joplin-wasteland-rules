# BASICS
## Reloading
The only two ways to find ammo in the “wasteland” or to buy ammo from the NPCs. Prices may be different for each vendor and the weight they sell for Caps.

## In Game Currency
The Currency used in this game is marked “ Caps.” You can earn these caps by performing roles, quests, jobs, looting other players/ NPC’s, selling items, and/or looting loot boxes. Red caps are worth one, blue are worth five and yellow are worth ten. 

## Grenade Count
Players are allowed to begin the game with a limited number of grenade-type weapons. The number of “grenade points” is six. Elemental smoke/frag grenades of any kind count as one. White smoke grenades do not count towards this number, and are deemed personal items.   

## Friendly fire counts
If you get hit by a friendly faction or team member you will still fall under the effects of whatever was used to hit you. 
Field items - Field items will be marked by orange tape, you may use these items in game and loot these items off of "bleeding out people.” 

## Purple taped items
These are not to be touched or messed with, as they may be personal player or NPC items. You can not use them, take them, or move them.

## Bleed Out
If affected by any “Combat Methods” you then have a one minute bleed out. You pull out your dead rag, you stay in place and can not use any “Combat Methods.” You must use the full one minute bleed out before you go back to spawn though anyone can be revived by anyone else with a stimpak during this bleed out time. Melee and perks can affect the basic bleed out rulings. 

## Spawns
If you are to “bleed out” and die, then you return to your spawn. However, if you get looted once before your one minute is up, then you go back to your spawn, even if your minute is not up. You cannot be looted on your way back to spawn after bleeding out even if you were not looted before. Your spawn is based on what faction you are a part of. All non-wanderer spawn have a npc that you communicate to respawn back into the game. The wanderer spawn has no npcs at said spawn and as such you must wait one minute at the wanderer spawn before respawning back into the game. With the wanderer spawn there is no combat allowed within 50 ft of the spawn. 

## Rad Zones
Radiation zones will be marked with radiation signs. If a rad sign is posted at a doorway to a building or in a hallway to a building, then the area behind that zone is a radiation zone. If a rad sign is out in the open, say posted on a tree, then the radiation zone is the area that is ten feet from that sign. If you step into a radiation zone and you do not use a Rad Stick beforehand you are now bleeding out. 

## Town Combat
Towns are meant to be centers of role play and vending. As such no full on faction on faction combat is to happen in these areas. Combat will be allowed in these towns, however the size limit of the group of aggressors will be based on the number of total players and npcs for each game. The number limit will be stated at the game brief. If the aggressors are able to wipe out the town members, they will have two minutes to clear the town or be subject to give all loot over to the town leader and return to their spawn. Those aggressors are not able to engage in town combat in groups of two or more as the aggressor’s for at least one hour. 

## Factions
You may join factions and quit factions throughout the day. To join a faction you must speak to the npc leader of the faction to join. You must also choose a player role that is listed for said faction. The lists will be present at game. If you think of a role that could fit for the faction you join and it is not listed, then speak to the npc leader about said role. All factions do give out caps when you join and also give out a wage based on your role and your effort put into said role. Your respawn will change from the wanderer spawn to your faction spawn and you will be marked with the faction colors. You MAY NOT loot other team members. If you wish to quit a faction, then you must speak to the npc leader of the faction and be a part of a faction for at least one hour before quitting. Understand by joining a faction we ask you to act the part and listen to your npc leaders, as this is a larp.  

## Player Roles
This is a role that you play and try to act out when a part of a faction. You can act out what you think your character would do in such a role, as long as it doesn’t break said role. An example would be a town guard role. You guard the town and enforce the laws of the town. If you want to be a bit corrupt, lazy or be strict with the law and wanderers that is fine. But you do not break the role and leave town to do other things, unless you switch roles. You may switch out roles by speaking to your npc faction leader. 

## Wanderers
If you do not join a faction, you are a wanderer and respawn at the wanderer spawn. If you wish to respawn at a faction town spawn you must ask the town leader first, then pay the doc/ healer their price. As a wanderer you have the most amount of freedom as you are not tied to a faction. Though this does mean you have to find other ways to make caps.  Wanderers can attack other wanderers and loot them.
