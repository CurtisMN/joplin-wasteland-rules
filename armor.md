# Armor
## Body>Ballistic Armor (bb proof)
Metal, tires, hard plastics, hardened leather, or EVA foam may be used to make armor. If you are hit in an armor piece by an airsoft round you are still in, but MUST yell out “armor hit.” All player armor will be approved before the game begins.
## Power Armor (Juggernaut)
Power armor must be approved by admins. Contact admins if you want to be eligible for power armor. One shot from a laser weapon causes the player to fall under Bleed Out rules. Power armor users are fitted with a “stun plate” shooting them here with an airsoft gun will stun them for 10 seconds. When a power armor user is stunned, they can be killed with an explosive weapon. Power Armor users can also be killed by removing their core from their back. This will look like a yellow and red rag hanging from their backside.  Power Armor users can not pick the agility or the endurance perk as their perk.
## Shields
Shields may be made of metal, plastic, kevlar, or wood . A few
examples could be; a stop sign, riot shield, tower shield, etc.
Shields stop melee attacks, airsoft rounds and laser rounds. For
safety reasons there is no shield bashing. All Shields must be
approved before they can be used.
