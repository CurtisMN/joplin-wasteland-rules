# Armor
## Body>Ballistic Armor (bb proof)
Metal, tires, hard plastics, hardened leather, or EVA foam may be
used to make armor. If you are hit in an armor piece by an airsoft
round you are still in, but MUST yell out “armor hit.”
## Power Armor (Juggernaut)
Power armor must be approved by admins. Contact admins if you want
to be eligible for power armor. Power armor can only be “killed”
by laser weapons, mini nukes, mortar and howitzer artillery-fired
shells. One shot from a laser weapon kills a power armor user. If
the Power armor user is within the “instant kill zone” (5ft of a
mini nuke, mortar or howitzer fired shell) they are dead. If the
power armor user is within the “bleeding out” zone the user is
stunned for 30 seconds. Power armor users are fitted with a “stun
plate” shooting them here with an airsoft gun will stun them for
10 seconds. When a power armor user is stunned, they can be killed
with an explosive weapon. Power Armor users can also be killed by
removing their core from their back. This will look like a yellow
and red rag hanging from their backside. Power Armor users can not
pick the agility or the endurance perk as their perk.
## Shields
Shields may be made of metal, plastic, kevlar, or wood . A few
examples could be; a stop sign, riot shield, tower shield, etc.
Shields stop melee attacks, airsoft rounds and laser rounds. For
safety reasons there is no shield bashing. All Shields must be
approved before they can be used.
