### Joplin Wasteland is proud to present our next event, The Winter Storm.

Nuclear winter as hit the town of Wate-Pa, making the wasteland a frozen pit of death. The town under is lockdown, with only guides and their groups having the means to brave the cold outside. The Trade Guild as left, leaving behind a few poor guards that have became highway bandits to fight for what they need. A group of raiders that worship the nuclear winter and the art of the Sword have over taken Raider Ruins, calling themselves the Frozen Blades. Some have even heard tales of a wandering beast and ghouls out in the wasteland. Will you be a Town Wanderer, a lost guard of the Trade Guild, a raider of the frozen blades or maybe a beast/ ghoul of the icy plains of Wate-Pa? Whatever you choose, gear up and get ready for The Winter Storm.
