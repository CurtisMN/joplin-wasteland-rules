# MEDICAL (HEALING) and LOOTING
## Healing Bags
To use, be next to the “bleeding” player. Count to fifthteen, then remove twine from the bag and pour the rice onto the ground. After that you must yell out, healing! The player is then back in the game.   

## Stimpaks
To use, be next to the “bleeding” player. Then push down on the syringe to remove the liquid/ paste. After that you must yell out, healing! The player is then back into the game. 

## Looting
You may loot people that are "bleeding out." You may only take two items of the following, off of the person. One item would count as the following: up to five caps, one field gun, one magazine, one medical item, one food item, one grenade, one piece of field armor, one field shield or one field melee weapon.

## Rad Sticks
To use, rip the paper of the stick and state “rad stick.” You then have one minute that you can use to be in a radiation zone. You may also use Rad Stick if a green smoke lands within kill range of you. If you are to use a rad stick for green smoke you must use the rad stick and then leave the area that the green smoke is affecting immediately, otherwise the player is “bleeding out.” 

## Carrying Bodies
You may use a two hand drag if your buddy is down. This means that if you put both your hands on your buddy he may get up and WALK to a new destination.
